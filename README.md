# ahk-libs
All the (redistributable) [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) libraries I can find...

Licenses are scattered around in there somewhere.

At the moment, this repo contains well over 200 libraries, classes, and
wrappers for [AHK 1.1](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) (previously AHK\_L),
AHK 1.0 (previously basic/vanilla), and [AHK v2](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/tree/alpha),
implemented in over 3000 scripts.

## AutoHotkey Library Distribution
Want more libs? Several projects have similar goals to this one:

* [pAHKlight](https://github.com/hi5/pAHKlight)
* [ASPDM](https://github.com/ahkscript/ASPDM), for
  [package/stdlib distribution and management](https://trello.com/b/XVP4M76d/package-stdlib-distribution-and-management)
  from the [ahkscript](https://github.com/ahkscript) folks
* [ALD](http://libba.net/) (discontinued)
* tuncay's original [ahkstdlib](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54996) (discontinued)
* [Salt](https://code.google.com/p/salt/) (discontinued)

## README!
Please note that, because this repo makes heavy use of git 'submodules',
downloading a zip or tarball is not useful. Instead, if you wish to have
access to all the libs included in this repo, please run:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/rshipp/ahk-libs.git
